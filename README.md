# Control Systems Modeling and Stability Analysis using MATLAB

This project demonstrates modeling and analysis of linear time-invariant (LTI) control systems using MATLAB.

## Analysis Performed
- Time-domain analysis using step response
- Stability analysis using root locus
- Frequency-domain analysis using Bode plots
- Evaluation of gain and phase margins

## Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Control System Toolbox

## Key Concepts
- Transfer function modeling
- Stability and relative stability
- Open-loop and closed-loop analysis
